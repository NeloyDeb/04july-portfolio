            <h3>President of china </h3>
            <p>Xi Jinping[note 2] (simplified Chinese: 习近平; traditional Chinese: 習近平; pinyin: Xí Jìnpíng, [ɕǐ tɕîn
                pʰǐŋ];
                born 15 June 1953) is a Chinese politician who has served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist
                Party (CCP) and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) since 2012, and President of the
                People's
                Republic of China (PRC) since 2013. Xi has been the paramount leader of China, the most prominent
                political
                leader in China, since 2012.</p>

            <h1>Dream to conquare the world</h1>
            <p>
                The plans for the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" extend to 2049, the year marking the 100th
                anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. By then, China should once again emerge
                as a global superpower. It seems as if the nobler the goals and the farther into the future their
                fulfilment, the greater the sacrifices one can demand from the people. When it comes to the
                "rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," nothing like civil liberties or cumbersome constitutional
                processes should come in the way, according to Beijing's view. Dissenters, human rights activists, even
                their lawyers end up in jail. The previously hard-won liberties, even in the media, are again being
                scaled back.

                    President Gotabaya Rajapaksa last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping assured Sri Lanka of “as much
